    One morning, my mother woke me up and told me that my Aunt Zeny and her children were
    downstairs. They came to invite us for a swim at the beach. The beach is just an hour
    away from our place, so my mom decided to go with them. My mom helped me prepare my
    bag. We did not cook any food since we would buy snacks on the way. I could see my
    cousins’ excitement as we headed towards the beach. I was excited, too.

        One Monday afternoon, Mike, adopting a very unusual style, wore a hoody. Nobody would
        ever think of wearing a hoody on a very hot day. His friends also wondered why he was
        being weird. They became a little aloof with Mike that day. The next day, Mike wore a
        hoody again, this time of a different color. This went on every day for a week and
        his friends gradually got used to it. Finally, on the eighth day, Mike wore a plain
        white shirt, acting like nothing had been amiss for the past week. One of his friends
        asked him, “Are you finally done with your hoody fashion?” “What hoody fashion?” Mike
        asked. “Last week, everyday, you kept on wearing a hoody.” And then Mike said, “What?
        I was on vacation last week. I just got home this morning. ”
